*objectives:*

* tdd workflow
* tdd is fundamentally code design
* code coverage/regression protection/etc.: side-effects
* test lists are design-by-example
* examples are concrete
* design behavior and test data with a test list
* commit the design
* test assertions are API designs
* run the assertion and see it fail
* compiler errors and assertion messages in the console drive the code
* write only enough code to change the console message
* commit after the green bar
* refactor via the 4 rules
* commit after refactor
* push after green test suite
